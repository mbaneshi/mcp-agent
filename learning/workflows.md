# Workflows Module Overview

The `workflows/` directory is a core part of the codebase, responsible for orchestrating and managing various workflow patterns and processes. Each subdirectory within `workflows/` represents a specific workflow implementation or pattern.

## Submodules and Concepts

- **workflow_evaluator_optimizer/**
  - Likely implements workflows for evaluating and optimizing tasks or models.
- **workflow_intent_classifier/**
  - Focuses on intent classification, possibly for natural language processing or user input understanding.
- **workflow_orchestrator_worker/**
  - Implements orchestration logic, coordinating multiple tasks or agents.
- **workflow_parallel/**
  - Handles parallel execution of tasks or processes.
- **workflow_router/**
  - Routes tasks or data to appropriate handlers or agents based on logic or rules.
- **workflow_swarm/**
  - Implements swarm intelligence or multi-agent collaboration workflows.

## Purpose
These workflows enable modular, reusable, and scalable orchestration of complex processes within the system. Each workflow can be extended or customized for specific use cases.

## Next Steps
- Explore each submodule in detail to document their internal structure and key components.
- Provide example usages and relationships with other parts of the codebase.
